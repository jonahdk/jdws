<h1>Jonah's Dog Walking Service</h1>
  <a href="/book/">Book a walk now!</a>

  This is Jonah, and this is my brand new site! If you want an appointment click above now!

<p>
  I only walk dogs in Barton Glen. If you do not live in Barton Glen then I cannot serve you.
  My prices are depending on how long the walk is. It is 50 cents per minute. ($2.50 for 5 minutes, $5 for 10 minutes, etc.) I accept cash, debit/credit cards, Paypal, and Bitcoin.
  I know the site doesn't look like much at all, but that is because I am still learning code. When I learn more code, I will definitely make this site much much better. <p> <br>
