# My Site
December 2 2020 <br>
Hello! This is the blog on my site! So far I've had the site for almost a month, and its going pretty well. This is also my very first site, so I'm hoping it does good. Today, I added my very first embed. The embed was for a form related to the site that I made. I created the site on November 4th and got a custom domain on November 7th. There is not much more to say, so see you tomorrow!

There hasn't been anything to say these past few days.

I added a webhook! Whenever I update the repo, I have it post saying that I updated in a Discord Server! Isn't that cool?? Anyway, theres nothing else I've done today, or even since the 2nd. Heheh. Anyway, see you next time!

I finally deleted the notice that we are temporarily closed because I have tested positive for COVID-19. Nothing else to say, except that those puppies are adorable! Alright, goodbye!

It's been over a year since I even touched the repository. I thought I had forgot code, but don't worry! As soon as I opened the file, my fingers were typing code faster than I could think of code to write!

Today, I FINALLY took out the notice for "Hey! We accept Bitcoin now!" thing. I also fixed an issue that didn't really do anything, but it would annoy other programmers/coders looking at the source code of the site. I added a DOCTYPE that says "<!DOCTYPE html>" at the top of the page. Anyway, see you whenever I have something to add!
