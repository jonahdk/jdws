# My Site
December 2 2020 <br>
Hello! This is the blog on my site! So far I've had the site for almost a month, and its going pretty well. This is also my very first site, so I'm hoping it does good. Today, I added my very first embed. The embed was for a form related to the site that I made. I created the site on November 4th and got a custom domain on November 7th. There is not much more to say, so see you tomorrow!

There hasn't been anything to say these past few days.

I added a webhook! Whenever I update the repo, I have it post saying that I updated in a Discord Server! Isn't that cool?? Anyway, theres nothing else I've done today, or even since the 2nd. Heheh. Anyway, see you next time!

December 9 2020-February 3 2021 <br>
I finally deleted the notice that we are temporarily closed because I have tested positive for COVID-19. Nothing else to say, except that those puppies are adorable! Alright, goodbye!

February 4 2021-May 30 2022 <br>
It's been over a year since I even touched the repository. I thought I had forgot code, but don't worry! As soon as I opened the file, my fingers were typing code faster than I could think of code to write!

Today, I FINALLY took out the notice for "Hey! We accept Bitcoin now!" thing. I also fixed an issue that didn't really do anything, but it would annoy other programmers/coders looking at the source code of the site. I added a DOCTYPE that says "<!DOCTYPE html>" at the top of the page. Anyway, see you whenever I have something to add!

I learned a little more code! Not much though, but atleast HOPEFULLY now the site can be HTTPS instead of HTTP. Haven't done much since I've been focusing on school and Donkey World (I reccomend not questioning the second one, but if you really want to know, <a href="http://www.mvmc.xyz">that's fine I guess.</a> but I came back for a day and did the equivalent of walking into an attic for the first time in 30 years and dusting/getting rid of cobwebs. See you when there's something new (if there ever is... DUN DUN DUNNNN)
